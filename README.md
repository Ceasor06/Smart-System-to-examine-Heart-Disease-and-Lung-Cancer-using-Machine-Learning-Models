# Smart-System-to-examine-Heart-Disease-and-Lung-Cancer-using-Machine-Learning-Models

It is the continuation of my previous project on Heart disease prediction, in this one I'm adding lung cancer prediction using 4 ML algorithms...

## Using heart disease patient data set to detect potential heart disease and warn the user of any future heart failures.


Nowadays, during this ongoing pandemic, patients face a situation of unanticipated demise due to specific heart diseases that are either left undiagnosed or too late to get detected. Early diagnosis of heart diseases is very important for the patient's life, as it is one of the crucial impacts of mortality in our country. In clinical data analysis, predicting cardiovascular disease is a primary challenge. Therefore, we propose a project to avoid these sudden deaths that uses a patients dataset to train different ML and DL models and later can predict the potential heart diseases.

**Size of the heart disease dataset contains 304 rows with 13 attributes.**


**Following are the attributes of Heart disease dataset:**

- Age 
* Sex 
+ Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
* Cholesterol 
+ Fasting Blood Pressure
- Resting Electrocardiographic Measurement
* Max Heart Rate Achieved
+ Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression 
* Slope 
+ Thalassemia
- Number of Major Vessels


## We have used 5 algorithms - 


1. K-NEAREST NEIGHBOURS

2. LOGISTIC REGRESSION 

3. RANDOM FOREST 

4. ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK using 2 hidden layer

5. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE 


### Algorithm which gives the best prediction for Heart disease is identified which is Logistic Regression with accuracy of 88.52%.

## Using lung patient data set to classify whether the patient has cancer or not.

Lung cancer is the major cause of cancer-related death in this generation, and it is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. It is feasible to treat lung cancer if the symptoms of the disease are detected early. It is possible to construct a sustainable prototype model for the treatment of lung cancer using the current developments in computational intelligence without negatively impacting the environment. Because it will reduce the number of resources squandered as well as the amount of work necessary to complete manual tasks, it will save both time and money.
Here we propose a simple prediciton of the lung cancer using ML.

**Size of the dataset for lung cancer contains 310 rows with 15 attributes.**

**Attributes for the lung dataset are :**

- Age	
* Sex	
+ Smoking
- Yellow Fingers	
* Anxiety	
+ Peer Pressure
- Chronic Disease	
* Fatigue 	
+ Allergy
- Wheezing	
* Alcohol Consumption
+ Coughing
- Shortness of Breath	
* Swallowing Difficulty	
+ Chest Pain

## The algorithms we used for lung cancer prediction are:

1. LOGISTIC REGRESSION

2. K-NEAREST NEIGHBOURS

3. X-GB CLASSIFIER 

4. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE

### Algorithm which gives the best prediction lung cancer is identified which is Logistic Regression with accuracy of 91.07%.


A user friendly mobile application is developed and the best algorithm is used as a model in the mobile application.
